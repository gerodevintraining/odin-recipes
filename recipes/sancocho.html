        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the beef, pork, and goat meat in a large bowl and season with lime juice, cilantro (or parsley), oregano, garlic, and a teaspoon of salt.<br>Coat meat with the seasoning. Marinate for at least half an hour, better an hour.</li>
            <li>In a large pot heat the oil over high heat, add the seasoned meats, and stir (be careful with hot oil splattering).<br>Cook stirring until browned. Add the remaining meats (chicken, pork ribs, ham bones, pork sausage) and corn, and cook stirring for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Lower heat to medium and pour ½ gallon [2.5 lt] of water. Simmer until it breaks the boil.</li>
            <li>Once the water breaks the boils, add auyama, chopped plantain, and root vegetables (ñame, yautía, yuca).<br>Grate, or scrape with the knife the remaining plantain to make it into a pulp, and add to the pot.</li>
            <li>Simmer covered over low heat until the last ingredients you added are cooked through, it should have thickened a bit too. If it dries too much, add water as necessary, or simmer uncovered to reduce if it is not thick enough for your taste.<br>Season with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and serve.</li>
